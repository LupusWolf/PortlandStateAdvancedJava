Project 6
This is a simple android application that
allows the user to store and retrieve
airline/flight data from storage. Click
the "Display Airline" button to pretty
print the airline listed into the textbox
below. Click the "add flight" button to
add a flight to the the given airline with
the given details. Click the "display
flights with given source and destination"
to search through the given airline for all
flights that match the given source and
destination. This app runs by passing in
a PrintWriter to a previously written
Commandline app to produce output for the
textbox. Make sure to scroll horizontally
to see all of the information printed in
the textbox.
