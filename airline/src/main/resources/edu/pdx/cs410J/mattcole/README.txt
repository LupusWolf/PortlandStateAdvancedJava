Project 4
CS510Java
This program takes in a set of flight details, then produces a flight object, and finally creates an airline object
containing that flight object. It then prints the flight details back to the user if the user uses the option -print. If
the user specifies a file using -textFile or -xmlFile then the program will first read the airline in from that file and
then will write the airline back out to that file when the program exits (using either a custom text format or xml
respectively). The -pretty command can be used to do a pretty print of the produced airline.
The usage in the specifications were:

usage: java -jar target/airline-2023.0.0.jar [options] <args>
